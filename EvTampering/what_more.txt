IMPORTANT:
1. remove events containing registry modification (on first switch. the second switch is written to other log)

less important:
3. number of events stays the same after deletion.
4. when deleting 2 close events, 3 and 4, event number 2 will be shown 3 times on event viewer.
5. deletion of first event on chunk.

Parse all events - from less than 10% to 98.2% of events are parsed. ill take that for now.
